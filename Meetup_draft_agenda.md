## Purpose / 目的
TThe UN Vector Tile Toolkit (UNVT) project started in 2018 and it has been developed as a part of the UN Open GIS Initiative which aims to develop an Open Source GIS bundle that meets the requirements of UN operations. 
UNVT includes a set of open source scripts to be used with existing and proven open-source vector tile software, and tools are further developed with the collaboration with the partners.
These active partners include Furuhashi Lab. at Aoyama Gakuin University and the Geospatial Information of Japan.

Because UNVT is scalable from a small portable PC like Raspberry Pi to a large server, various application of UNVT are expected (e.g. like UNVT portable, an application at disaster response). 
With the aim of expanding the use of UNVT and further developing tools, Furuhashi Lab. with the support from UN Open GIS Initiative, UN Geospatial Information Section, and UN Mappers(tbd), has hold a hackthon starting from 14 December 2021.

UNVT community in Japan is happy to have a casual meetup to see the work of the hackathon participants and congratulate on their works. The meetup will also provide an opportunity to share ideas and use cases of the UNVT and related open source geospatial tools.
